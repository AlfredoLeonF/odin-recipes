    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that combines layers of pasta, seasoned
      ground beef, tomato sauce, and a mix of cheeses to create an unforgettable
      culinary experience. To prepare it, first, saut√© the ground beef with
      onion, garlic, and spices like oregano and basil, then mix it with a rich
      tomato sauce. In a baking dish, alternate layers of pre-cooked pasta with
      the meat and sauce mixture, along with generous layers of ricotta and
      mozzarella cheese, finishing with a top layer of grated Parmesan cheese.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once assembled, the lasagna is baked until the cheese layers melt and
      lightly brown on top, while the flavors blend and intensify. After
      removing it from the oven, let it rest for a few minutes to allow the
      layers to set, then cut into perfect portions for serving. This
      traditional dish, with its combination of textures and flavors, is ideal
      for family dinners and special gatherings, and is sure to be a hit among
      all diners.
