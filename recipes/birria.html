    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Birria de Res is a flavorful and aromatic Mexican stew traditionally made
      with beef. This dish, originating from Jalisco, is known for its rich
      broth, tender meat, and the deep, complex flavors imparted by a
      combination of dried chiles and spices. The beef is marinated and then
      slow-cooked until it falls apart easily, resulting in a deliciously savory
      stew. Birria de Res can be served as a soup with the broth or used as a
      filling for tacos, garnished with fresh cilantro, chopped onions, and a
      squeeze of lime for an extra burst of flavor.
    </p>

    <p>
      This dish is often enjoyed during special occasions and family gatherings,
      bringing people together over its hearty and comforting taste. The process
      of making Birria de Res involves marinating the beef in a vibrant chile
      sauce, then simmering it slowly to allow the flavors to meld perfectly.
      The result is a mouthwatering stew that captures the essence of
      traditional Mexican cuisine, offering a delightful combination of spice,
      warmth, and robust taste.
